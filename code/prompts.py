        4. Recommend a frequency that aligns with the user's schedule and fitness level.
        5. Consider user's preference for indoor, outdoor, or both types of activities.
        6. Include any specified equipment or preferences for particular sports or outdoor activities.

        **Language Processing:**
        * Utilize NLP techniques to understand user preferences and tailor the routine accordingly.

        **Image Recognition:**

        **Additional Considerations:**
        * Clearly state the purpose of each exercise and its benefits towards achieving the user's fitness goal.
        * Provide modifications or alternatives for exercises if certain activities cannot be performed due to limitations.
        * Encourage proper warm-up and cool-down exercises before and after the routine.
        * Acknowledge the source of fitness information (if used).
        * If any instruction is missing, use your best judgment to assume it.
